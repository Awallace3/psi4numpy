## Direct Inversion of the Iterative Subspace (DIIS)

Direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS) is a generic convergence accelleration technique which can be applied to iterative methods for solving lienar and nonlinear systems of equations.  In this tutorial, we will discuss DIIS in a general framework, before applying it to speed up the self-consistent solution of equations in the RHF program written in tutorial 2a.
