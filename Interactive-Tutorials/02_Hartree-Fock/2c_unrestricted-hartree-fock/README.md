Unrestricted Hartree-Fock
=========================

This tutorial introduces the theory of the open-shell, unrestricted orbital formulation of Hartree-Fock Molecular Orbital Theory (UHF), and guides the reader through an implementation of UHF which also employs Direct Inversion of the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) convergence accelleration.
