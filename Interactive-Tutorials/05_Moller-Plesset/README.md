Moller-Plesset Perturbation Theory
==================================

This module offers the following tutorials which seek to discuss the theory and implementation of Moller-Plesset perturbation theory:

- (5a) Canonical MP2: Introduces second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory, and aids the reader in the implementation of a conventional MP2 program utilizing full ERI tensors.


Planned tutorials:
- Density-Fitted MP2: Discusses the application of density fitting to the implementation of MP2.

- MP3: Introduces the theory and implementation of third order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory.
