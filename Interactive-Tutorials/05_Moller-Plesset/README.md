Moller-Plesset Perturbation Theory
==================================

This module offers the following tutorials which seek to discuss the theory and implementation of Moller-Plesset perturbation theory:

- (5a) Conventional MP2: Introduces second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory, and aids the reader in the implementation of a conventional MP2 program utilizing full ERI tensors.

- (5b) Density-Fitted MP2: Discusses the implementation of the density-fitted formulation of MP2 in an efficient algorithm making use of ERI permutational symmetry.

Planned tutorials:

- MP3: Introduces the theory and implementation of third order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory.
