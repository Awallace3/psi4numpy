## Psi4NumPy Basics

This module seeks to familiarize the reader with the basics of interacting directly with the class structure and functionality of the Psi4 program via the Python interface.  For a more general overview of using Psi4 within Python, please refer to the documentation [here](https://github.com/dsirianni/psi4_api-docs).  Each tutorial in this module introduces a particular Psi4 class object, all of which will be employed during the course of future modules.  Current tutorials include:

* Molecule: Building molecules, geometry specification, and computing molecule properties 
* Wavefunction: Building wavefunction objects and returning wavefunction properties
* BasisSet: Building basis sets for use in density fitting, etc.
* MintsHelper: Overview of how to get anything you'd ever need or want from Psi4

Each of these tutorials introduces the interface to, instantiation of, and most common uses of these classes; however for a more complete (and admittedly cryptic) overview, please refer directly to the Psi4 API [here](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/psi4api.html#).
