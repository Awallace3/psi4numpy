    "# Overlap, Kinetic, and Dipole Integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will compute the overlap and kinetic energy integrals encountered in Hartree-Fock. We will also compute the dipole integrals to obtain the molecular dipole moment. \n",

    "## Recurrence formula for one-electron integrals over Gaussian functions\n",
    "Direct calculation of all integrals is not only complicated, but expensive. Here, we will implement an Obara-Saika recursion scheme for a simpler and more efficient implementation. For example, for the overlap integrals, given the value of $(s|s)$, one can recursively determine all other overlap integrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cartesian Gaussian functions\n",
    "Denote the origin of a 3-dimensional cartesian gaussian function by the coordinates $\\mathbf{R} = (R_x, R_y, R_z)$.\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)$ be the coordinates of the electron, and $\\alpha$ be the orbital exponent. We can now define an *unnormalized* cartesian gaussian function as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\phi(\\mathbf r; \\alpha, \\mathbf n, \\mathbf R) = (x - R_x)^{n_x} (y - R_y)^{n_y} (z - R_z)^{n_z} \\exp[-\\alpha (\\mathbf r - \\mathbf R)^2]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is the orbital exponent, and $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is the angular momentum index vector. The sum $n_x + n_y + n_z = \\lambda$ will hereafter be referred to as the **angular momentum**. We define a **shell** to be a set of functions (*components*) which share the same origin $\\mathbf{R}$, angular momentum $\\lambda$, and orbital exponent $\\alpha$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shells with $\\lambda$  equal to $0, 1, 2,...,$ are referred to as the $s, p, d, ...$ shell. Each shell has $(\\lambda + 1) (\\lambda + 2)/2$ components. The $s$ shell, with angular momentum $\\lambda = 0$ has one component usually designated as $s$. The $p$ shell ($\\lambda = 1$) has three components, designated as $p_x, p_y, p_z$. The $d$ shell ($\\lambda = 2$) has six components, designated as $d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum chemistry, we typically represent a single component (an **atomic orbital**) by a linear combination of gaussians, hereon referred to as **primitives**. For example, the STO-3G basis set uses three primitives for each atomic orbital basis function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our angular momentum index vector $\\mathbf{n}$ we denote the single component of the $s$ shell to have angular momentum index $\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{0} = (0, 0, 0)$. Since the $p$ shell has three components, we may compactly express the angular momentum index vector as $\\mathbf{1}_i$ where $i$ may be $x$, $y$, or $z$, and $\\mathbf{1}_i = (\\delta_{ix}, \\delta_{iy}, \\delta_{iz})$. For example, $p_x$ may be represented as $\\mathbf{1}_x = (1, 0, 0)$. For the six components of the $d$ shell, we require a sum of two angular momentum index vectors $\\mathbf{1}_i + \\mathbf{1}_j$, where $(i,j = x,y,z)$. In this notation, the $d_{xy}$ component is $\\mathbf{1}_x + \\mathbf{1}_y = (1,0,0) + (0,1,0) = (1,1,0)$. To obtain higher order angular momentum components, we add the appropriate number of $\\mathbf{1}_i$'s ($\\mathbf{n}$'s)\n",

    "\n",
