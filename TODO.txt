Next up:
- Density Fitting
    DF Tensors are implemented, unfortunately pure einsum implementations of DF
    expressions yields memory overhead equal to the a full rank ERI implementation.
    Need to write things in python loops, bleh.
- alternative HF accelerators
    Second-order SCF (NR, BFGS, etc)
- alternative HF guess
    SAD
    Anything else?

Future:
- Determinant based CI
    There might not be a good way to do this in psi4numpy without a lot of C
    legwork.
    - CISD
    - MCSCF
    - CASSCF

- F12 Methods
    This may be trivial, needs C side work.
