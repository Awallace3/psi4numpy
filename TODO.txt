Next up:
- Finish CCSD
- Add CCSD(T) and CCSD DIIS
- Move tutorials to wiki and add the following:
    - ndarray views, B = Arr[:, :val]
    - Broadcasting energy denominators, Eocc.reshape(-1, 1) - Evirt
    - In depth einsum guide

Future works:
- Determinant based CI
    - CISD
    - MCSCF
    - CASSCF

- Linear Response
    - CPHF
    - SAPT  

Building infrastucture is a slippery slope, many diverse functions
defeats the purpose of this work. However, it likely worth building a
reference platform for RHF, maybe UHF and ROHF as well.

Infrastructure improvements:
- SCF reference
- Spatial MO integrals
- Spin MO integrals
