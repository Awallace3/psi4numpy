### Overview

The overall goal of the Psi4NumPy project is to provide an interactive quantum chemistry
framework for reference implementations, rapid prototyping, development, and education.
To do this, quantities relevant to quantum chemistry are computed with the
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Psi4 </span> electronic structure package, and subsequently manipulated 
using the Numerical Python (NumPy) package.  This combination
provides an interface that is both simple to use and remains relatively fast
to execute. 

A series of short scripts demonstrating the implementation of Hartree-Fock Self-Consistent 
Field, SCF Response, MÃ¸ller-Plesset Perturbation Theory, Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory, 
Coupled Cluster Theory, and more are provided for the reference of the quantum chemistry
community at large to facilitate both reproducibility and low-level methodological understanding.
Additionally, the Tutorials folder above represents an interactive educational
environment containing modules discussing the theory and implementation of various
quantum and computational chemistry methods.  By leveraging the popular Jupyter Notebook
application, each tutorial is constructed as hybrid theory and programming in an easy to use
interactive environment, removing the gap between theory and implementation.

If you have comments, questions, or would like to contribute to the project
please see our [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Getting Started

1. Obtain required software
    1. [Psi4](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1/build_obtaining.html)
        * Option 1 (easiest): [Download installer](http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/psicode-download/1.1.html) and install according to [instructions](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1/conda.html#how-to-install-a-psi4-binary-with-the-psi4conda-installer-command-line).
          ```
          # Have Psi4conda installer (http://psicode.org/downloads.html)
          >>> bash psi4conda-{various}.sh
          # Check `psi4` command in path; adjust path if needed
          # **IF** using DFT tutorials,
          >>> conda update psi4 -c psi4/label/dev
          ```
        * Option 2 (easy): Download Conda package according to [instructions](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/1.1/conda.html#how-to-install-a-psi4-binary-into-an-ana-miniconda-distribution)
          ```
          # Have Anaconda or Miniconda (https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
          >>> conda create -n p4env psi4 -c psi4
          >>> bash
          >>> source activate p4env
          # Check `psi4` command in path; adjust path if needed
          # **IF** using DFT tutorials,
          >>> conda update psi4 -c psi4/label/dev
          ```
        * Option 3 (medium): [Clone source](https://github.com/psi4/psi4) and [compile](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L16-L123) according to [instructions](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_faq.html#configuring-building-and-installing-psifour-via-source)
          ```
          # Get Psi4 source
          >>> git clone https://github.com/psi4/psi4.git
          >>> git checkout v1.1
          >>> cmake -H. -Bobjdir -Doption=value ...
          >>> cd objdir && make -j`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`
          # Find `psi4` command at objdir/stage/<TAB>/<TAB>/.../bin/psi4; adjust path if needed
          # **IF** using DFT tutorials,
          >>> git checkout master
          # `make` again
          ```
    2. [Python](https://python.org) 2.7+ (incl. w/ Options 1 & 2)
    3. [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) 1.7.2+ (incl. w/ Options 1 & 2)
    4. [Scipy](https://scipy.org) 0.13.0+
2. Enable Psi4 & PsiAPI
   1. Find appropriate paths
        ```
        >>> psi4 --psiapi-path
        export PATH=/path/to/dir/of/python/interpreter/against/which/psi4/compiled:$PATH
        export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/dir/of/psi4/core-dot-so:$PYTHONPATH
        ```
    2. Export relevant paths
        ```
        >>> bash
        >>> export PATH=/path/to/dir/of/python/interpreter/against/which/psi4/compiled:$PATH
        >>> export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/dir/of/psi4/core-dot-so:$PYTHONPATH
        ```
3. Run scripts as conventional Python scripts
    * Example: Run `DF-MP2.py`
        ```
        >>> python psi4numpy/Moller-Plesset/DF-MP2.py
        ```

New users can follow the
[Getting Started](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/blob/master/Tutorials/01_Psi4NumPy-Basics/1a_Getting-Started.ipynb)
notebook or the [PsiAPI documentation](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/psiapi.html) for an introduction to running Psi4 within the PsiAPI.

A tutorial that covers the basics of NumPy can be found
[here](http://wiki.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial).

### Repository Organization

This repository contains

* reference implementations, which provide working Python scripts implementing
various quantum chemical methods, and
* interactive tutorials, which provide Jupyter notebooks presenting a hybrid
theory-and-implementation educational framework for learning to program quantum
chemistry methods.

Reference implementations are organized into top-level directories
corresponding to the over-arching theory upon which each method is based, i.e.,
both EOM-CCSD and TD-CCSD are contained in the
[Coupled-Cluster](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/tree/master/Coupled-Cluster)
directory.  All interactive tutorials are contained in the top-level directory
[Tutorials](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/tree/master/Tutorials).  These
tutorials are organized in logical order of progression, which is enumerated in
detail
[here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/tree/master/Tutorials#interactive-tutorials).

### Psi4 v1.1
This repostitory has recently been updated to be compatible with Psi4 version 1.1.
Please see the `v1.0` branch for a Psi4 v1.0 compliant Psi4NumPy version.
